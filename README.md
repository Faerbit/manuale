# ManuaLE

manuale is a lightweight [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)/[ACME](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/) client designed for a manual workflow. It contains no automation features whatsoever and is intended to be called by a human.

## Why?

Isn't the point of Let's Encrypt to be automatic and seamless? Maybe, but here's some reasons:

* You're not comfortable with an automatic process handling something as critical, or your complex infrastructure doesn't allow it in the first place.

* You already have perfect configuration management with something like Ansible. Renewing is a matter of dropping in a new certificate. With a manual client that works, it's literally a minute of work.

* You want the traditional and authentic SSL installation experience of copying files you don't understand to your server, searching for configuration instructions and praying that it works.

## Features

* Simple interface with no hoops to jump through. Keys and certificate signing requests are automatically generated: no more cryptic OpenSSL one-liners.

* Support for DNS validation. No need to figure out how to serve challenge files from a live domain. (In fact, that's the only validation method supported.)

* Authorization is separate from certificate issuance. Authorizations last for months on Let's Encrypt: there's no need to waste time validating the domain every time you renew the certificate.

* Obviously, runs without root access. Use it from any machine you want, it doesn't care. Internet connection recommended.

* Awful, undiscoverable name.

* And finally, if the `openssl` binary is your spirit animal, you can still bring your own keys and/or CSR's. Everybody wins.

## Installation

For now, install through the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/veeti/manuale ~/.manuale
    cd ~/.manuale
    virtualenv3 env
    env/bin/python setup.py install
    ln -s env/bin/manuale ~/.bin/

You need Python 3. It's 2016.

(Assuming that you have a `~/.bin` directory that's in your `PATH`.)

## Usage

You need to create an account once. To do so, call `manuale register [email]`. This will create a new account key for you. Follow the registration instructions.

Once that's done, you'll have your account saved in `account.json` in the current directory. You'll need this to do anything useful. Oh, and it contains your private key, so keep it safe and secure.

`manuale` expects the account file to be in your working directory by default, so you'll probably want to make a specific directory to do all your certificate stuff in. Likewise, created certificates get saved in the current path by default.

Next up, verify your the domains you want a certificate for one-by-one with `manuale authorize [domain]`. This will show you the DNS record you need to create and wait for you to do it. For example, you might do it for `example.com` and `www.example.com`.

Once that's done, you can finally get down to business. Run `manuale issue example.com www.example.com` to get your certificate. It'll save the key, certificate and certificate with intermediate to the working directory.

There's plenty of documentation inside each command. Run `manuale [command] -h` for details.
